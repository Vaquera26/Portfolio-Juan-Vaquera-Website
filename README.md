# 🌐 **Portfolio - Juan Fernando Vaquera Sanchez** 🌐

Hey there! I’m **Juan Fernando Vaquera Sanchez**, and this is my personal portfolio. It’s a website where you can get to know me better, check out my work, and learn about the projects I’m passionate about. I built it using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, and it’s fully responsive, so you can check it out on any device—whether it’s your phone, tablet, or desktop.
